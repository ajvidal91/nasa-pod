# NASA's Picture Of The Day Generator

This is an application in which I utilize the NASA's Picture of the Day API,
which grabs the picture of the day from the date entered by the user.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, $AJAX, and an API

With the ajax request to the NASA API, it grabs the picture from the date inputed
by the user. CSS provides the background image for the body as well as providing
the style for the font,input, and buttons.

## Optimizations


When I initially pushed the project onto github it worked, however it was plain,
and not anything special to look at. I added some CSS, and now its an experience
that the user can enjoy!

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first experience utilizing API's, and I learned alot of value information
and how to pull off an AJAX request.
